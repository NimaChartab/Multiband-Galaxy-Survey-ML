# Multiband-Galaxy-Survey-ML
Repository for the machine learning analysis of multiband galaxy surveys as presented in [A Machine-learning Approach to Predict Missing Flux Densities in Multiband Galaxy Surveys](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acacf5/meta) (Chartab et al. 2023).

The following methods are applied within this repository:

- Information Gain for assessing photometric band significance for redshift and stellar mass measurements.
- UMAP for high-dimensional photometric data visualization.
- Random Forest for flux density imputation.
- Comparative analysis for ML versus conventional SED fitting techniques.
